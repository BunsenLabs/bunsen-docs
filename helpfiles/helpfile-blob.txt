BLOB - The BunsenLabs theme management script
=============================================

bl-obthemes is a script to save or restore gui theme settings,
 from a graphical user interface based on yad.

To launch from the BL Menu: Utilities -> BLOB Themes Manager

To launch from a terminal: bl-obthemes [-h|--help][-v|--verbose]
Optional arguments:
        -h, --help      show a help message
        -v, -d, --verbose, --debug   describe actions being performed
No other CLI options are supported, and the user interface remains graphic.


The initial BLOB window
=======================

Options:
    "Save Settings": The current theme settings of important applications will be saved
    to a directory in ~/.config/blob, with a name of your choosing.

    "View Saved": The saved theme collections ("blobs") will be shown,
    and you can choose one to restore. Some blobs come pre-installed for you to try,
    others will be added by you.

    "Help": Show this document.

    "Close": Exit BLOB.


Save options
============

When you have set up the looks of your desktop and windows how you like them,
all the settings can be saved as a single collection for future restoration.

After choosing a name for the new "blob", you can check over the list of
configurations to be saved:

            Openbox theme

            GTK theme including Icon theme

            Background
            (uses Nitrogen or feh, depending which has the newer saved bg config file)

            Running Conky(s)

            Running Tint2(s)

            Alt Menu (dmenu)

            Lightdm login gtk greeter

            X config (.Xresources)

            Bash config (.bashrc)

            Compositor settings

            jgmenu settings

            Terminal emulator config (if available)

Everything will be saved to the new blob, but on restoring you can choose which configs to restore.

A screenshot is stored with each blob, so you can remember what it looks like.
    (Windows are hidden briefly so the image is the bare desktop, with any Tint2s
    or Conkys which are running, and a representive menu and window open.)


Restore Options
===============

Open the "View Saved" window to see what blobs are available to restore.

Options:
    "View Image": see the screenshot close up.

    "Add New": the "Save Settings" dialogue.

    "Restore": restore the selected blob.

    etc.

Several blobs are shipped with Bunsenlabs, so you can try some alternative desktop appearances.
The current default desktop is also available as "Beryllium" in case you want to come back.

If some of your configs are different from when your last blob was saved,
they will be overwitten when restoring a different blob.
This situation is detected, and you can save your current desktop before continuing,
if you want. You can view file differences before deciding.

When you restore a blob, you can choose which specific configs you want to restore.
Others will be left as they are now.


Configuration
=============

Some variables at the top of the script can be adjusted to suit your needs.
Copy /usr/bin/bl-obthemes to ~/bin, and edit your local copy.
Make sure it is the new default by running 'which bl-obthemes'.

 USER VARIABLE: xdotool is used to move the mouse pointer, and assumes the
 root-menu is shown with "Super + Space" keys, and the right mouse button is
 set for "r-click". If you have set these to something else, then edit the
 "MENUMODIFIER" variable and "MOUSECMD" array.
 Set the variable "KEYDOWN" to where "Preferences" is in the root-menu (or
 anything else you might want displayed).
 The image viewer is set to be "bl-image-viewer". Edit the "IMGCMD" variable
 to change this.

WARNING:
 Conkys in non-default directories are saved,
 but will not be seen when running the bl conky manager.

KNOWN ISSUES:
 Virtualbox does not allow the guest to move the host mouse cursor,
 using xdotool, so the screenshot may produce an incorrect theme displayed
 and/or poor positioning.
 A workaround is to move the cursor to some free space, and use
 the "Enter" key in the "Configurations to be saved:" dialog.
