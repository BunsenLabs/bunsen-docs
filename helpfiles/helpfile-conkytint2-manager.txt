BunsenLabs Conky and Tint2 Management
=====================================

BunsenLabs provides a number of tools to make using conky and tint2 easier.

Conky
=====

Many people like to run several conkys at the same time in their desktop session.
A Conky "session" makes this easy to organize with a "conky sessionfile"
 - a text file holding a list of conky config files' paths, something like this:

.config/conky/First-conky.conf
.config/conky/possible_subdir/Second-conky.conf

(Paths can be absolute or relative - see bl-conky-session below.)

It is possible to have several alternative conky sessionfiles.
When a user logs in, the default conky session ~/.config/conky/conky-startup-session is run.
This is a symlink which points, by default, to ~/.config/conky/conky-sessionfile,
but can easily be changed to point to a different sessionfile, so that will be used on login.
It is also easy to switch from one conky session to another during a desktop session.


The Conky Pipemenu
==================

Menu > Preferences > Conky

Items:
    "Conky Manager": You can choose conkys to run from all those available.
    See "bl-conky-manager" below.

    "Edit Conkys": Choose a conky config to edit. There are menu options to
    choose from all conkys, the running conkys, or just the default conky.
    See "bl-conky-edit" below.

    "Move a Conky": move any currently visible conky to a new place on the desktop.
    See "bl-conkymove" below.

    "Reload Startup Session": conkys are reset to those in the startup sessionfile.
    See "bl-conky-session" below.

    "New Conky Session": choose a new session name and choose the conkys to run.
    (Empty sessions are possible too.)

    "Saved Sessions": if more than one sessionfile exists, choose one to run.

    "Choose Startup Session": the startup symlink mentioned above is changed to
    point to the chosen sessionfile.

    "Conky Manager Help": open this document.


bl-conky-manager
================

From menu: Preferences > Conky > Conky Manager

From terminal: bl-conky-manager
    Options:
        -h,--help : show help message
        -f,--file <FILENAME> : specify file to save session to
        -z,--choose-sessfile : run gui filename entry dialog for new saved session
        -s,--choose-startup  : choose session file to run at startup

All available conky config files in ~/.config/conky are shown with checkboxes.
Those currently running are shown checked.
Check the ones you want to run, uncheck the ones to stop, and click "Apply".
Your chosen conky session will be saved to the default startup sessionfile.

If you have chosen to create a new session the selected conkys will be saved there instead.

If you choose to start a conky which is not "sticky",
you will be prompted to choose which desktop to launch it on.
The desktop will be saved in the sessionfile (see bl-conky-session below).

NOTE: Although the conky session manager allows conkys to be anywhere in $HOME,
the conky manager only handles conkys which are in ~/.config/conky.


bl-conky-edit
=============

From menu: Preferences > Conky > Edit Conkys > Conky Editor

From terminal: bl-conky-edit
    Options:
        -h,--help : show help message

As with bl-conky-manager, a listbox with all the conkys available will be shown for editing.
Chosen conky config files will open in the default text editor.
Multiple conkys can be opened for editing at the same time.


bl-conkymove
============

From menu: Preferences > Conky > Move a Conky

From terminal: bl-conkymove
    Options:
        -h,--help : show help message

You will be invited to click on a conky to identify it, then Alt+LeftMouse drag it
to its new position. The new position will be written to the conky config file.


bl-conky-session
================

From menu: Preferences > Conky >
    "Reload Startup Session", "New Conky Session", "Saved Sessions" and "Choose Startup Session"
    all use bl-conky session. ("Choose Startup Session" uses bl-conky-manager too.)

From terminal: bl-conky-session
    Options:
        -h,--help : show help message
        <no argument> : run the default startup sessionfile
        <filepath1> [<filepath2>...] : run all these sessionfiles
        --default : add the default startup sessionfile to the list to run
        --kill-running : kill current running conkys without prompting
        --set-startup <file> : set <file> as default startup sessionfile
            (Use "default" to reset startup session to conky-sessionfile.)
        --list : list available session files

Conky sessionfile paths can be absolute (start with /) or relative to ~/.config/conky,
The conky paths inside the sessionfiles can be absolute, relative to ~/.config/conky or relative to ~/.
(~/.config/conky will be checked first)

Conkys are usually configured as "sticky" so they run on all desktops simultaneously,
but can also be set in the sessionfile to run on one desktop only.
For example, such an entry to run a conky on Desktop 1 would look like this:

D[1] .config/conky/possible_subdir/MySpecial-conky.conf

(Desktop numbering starts at 0)


Tint2
=====

There is a smaller set of tint2 management tools, and they work like the conky tools.


The tint2 pipemenu
==================

Menu > Preferences > Tint2

Items:
    "Tint2 Manager": shows a checkbox list like the conky manager.

    "Restart Tint2": kill all running tint2 instances and restart them with the same arguments

    "Reload Default Session": kill tint2s and reload the default ~/.config/tint2/tint2-sessionfile

    "Edit tint2s": the same options as for conky


bl-tint2-manager
================

From menu: Preferences > Tint2 > Tint2 Manager

From terminal: bl-tint2-manager
    Options:
        -h,--help : show help message

The tint2 manager displays tint2 files inside ~/.config/tint2 which can be
checked or unchecked as with the conky manager.

Only the default ~/.config/tint2/tint2-sessionfile is used.


bl-tint2-edit
=============

From menu: Preferences > Tint2 > Edit Tint2s > Tint2 Editor

From terminal: bl-tint2-edit
    Options:
        -h,--help : show help message

A listbox with all the tint2s available will be shown for editing, as with conky.


bl-tint2-session
================

From menu: Preferences > Tint2 > Reload Default Session

From terminal: bl-tint2-session
    Options:
        -h,--help : show help message

Tint2 sessionfile paths can be absolute (start with /) or relative to ~/.config/tint2,
The tint2 paths inside the sessionfiles can be absolute, relative to ~/.config/tint2 or relative to ~/.
(~/.config/tint2 will be checked first)

When called, bl-tint2-session will kill any running tint2s and start those
which are written in the default tint2 sessionfile ~/.config/tint2/tint2-sessionfile

If any sessionfiles are passed as arguments they will be loaded instead of the default.
Multiple sessionfiles can be loaded.

There is no support for setting a specific desktop with tint2.


Conky and Tint2 sessionfiles can be edited by hand as well as via the GUI tools.
