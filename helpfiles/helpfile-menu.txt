How to edit a jgmenu menu
=========================

*********  It is strongly recommended you make a backup first!  *************

The "Applications" submenu is auto-updating,
but other parts of the menu are static, except for pipemenus..

Edit "~/.config/jgmenu/prepend.csv in a text editor.

The basic syntax is very simple:

	label,command
	
See 'man jgmenu' for details.

How to edit an Openbox menu
===========================

*********  It is strongly recommended you make a backup first!  *************

The Openbox menu does not auto-update, it needs to be edited by the user.

Edit "~/.config/openbox/menu.xml" using a text editor.
    
(Links to more detailed info can be found in the Online Help for Openbox in the Help menu)


HowTo edit a BunsenLabs pipemenu
================================

    Menus, eg bl-help-pipemenu, are in "/usr/bin/"

 *** Remember that they could be over-written by a BL package upgrade, 
	 so use the following method instead of editing the file as root ***
 
	1) Copy the file from /usr/bin to ~/bin (create directory if necessary).
	2) Check ~/bin comes first in $PATH (use 'echo $PATH' to check)
	3) Edit the local file

jgmenu can use xml pipemenus written for Openbox, or csv pipemenus.

*)  CSV pipemenus output csv code which can be used directly by jgmenu.
    These will run faster and more reliably (but the xml menus written 
    for Openbox will also run fine in jgmenu).
    
    CSV pipemenus use the menu generation functions provided in
    /usr/lib/bunsen/common/bl-includes and have entries like:
    
    	jgmenuItem 'takescrot' "scrot Now" "scrot $IMG -e $VIEW"

    The first element is a tag indicating which submenu the item goes in,
    tag "root" means the root menu. The second is the label,
    the third is the command to run.


*) XML pipemenus output xml menus which can be used by Openbox or jgmenu.

	They have menu entries like:

        menuItem 'Forum Basic Help & Support' 'x-www-browser "https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewforum.php?id=2"'
        
    The first element is the label, the second is the command to be run.
    
Please see the first section of /usr/lib/bunsen/common/bl-includes
for all the menu generation functions, both jgmenu and openbox.
    
Recent Files Pipemenu
=====================

Run "bl-recent-files-pipemenu -h" to show the usage of the command.

To change how the menu displays recent files, you can add the following switches
to the menu.xml pipemenu entry:

	-r, --reverse    Put the most-recently used items at the top of the menu
	-l, --limit  NUM     Include up to NUM items in the menu

So to have the most recent 20 items displayed, with the newest first, use:

	<menu execute="bl-recent-files-pipemenu -r -l 20" id="pipe-recentfilesmenu" label="Recent Files"/>
